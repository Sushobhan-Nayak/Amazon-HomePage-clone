# Amazon-HomePage-clone

Welcome to the **Amazon Home Page Clone** repository! This project serves as a demonstration of my journey in learning the basics of HTML and CSS. In this repository, you'll find a simple clone of the Amazon home page that I created as a learning exercise. This project helped me gain a better understanding of structuring web content using HTML and styling it using CSS.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to replicate the Amazon home page layout and design using HTML and CSS. While this clone may not have all the dynamic functionality of the actual Amazon website, it provided an excellent opportunity to practice creating responsive layouts and styling elements.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I focused on achieving the following learning objectives:

- **HTML Structure**: I learned how to create the basic structure of a web page using HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists.

- **CSS Styling**: I explored various CSS properties to style different elements on the page, including fonts, colors, margins, padding, and more.

- **Responsive Design**: I experimented with CSS techniques to make the layout responsive, ensuring that the page looks good on various screen sizes.

- **Box Model**: I gained a deeper understanding of the CSS box model and how it affects the sizing and spacing of elements.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML markup that defines the structure of the Amazon home page clone.
- `styles.css`: The CSS stylesheet containing the styling rules to replicate the visual design of the Amazon home page.

## Getting Started

To view the Amazon Home Page Clone, you can open the `https://sushobhan-nayak.github.io/Amazon-HomePage-clone/` file in a web browser. The CSS styles are linked to the HTML file, so the styling will be applied automatically.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with changes to further your understanding of HTML and CSS.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to the resources that helped me learn and complete this project. Online tutorials, documentation, and examples were instrumental in guiding me through the process.

## Conclusion

Creating this Amazon Home Page Clone was an enlightening journey into the world of web development. By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to continue building on this foundation to create more complex and interactive web projects in the future.
